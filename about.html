<h2>
    An experiment in creating a TODO list in pure Javascript,
    no frameworks, and no backends
</h2>

<p>
    <a href="./">Back</a>
</p>

<p>
    I wanted to create a TODO list for two reasons. 1) To brush up on modern
    javascript and 2) I wanted a TODO list that wasn't an app that needed to be installed
    or that required a login.
</p>
<p>
    I decided to use plain Javascript to learn what
    was available these days (~2020) and because I didn't need to worry about compatibility back
    to 2005-era-browsers. I've had bad experience using frameworks for personal projects as these are
    projects that tend to get neglected for long periods of time. When I come back to them the
    native code works fine but the framework is woefully out of date and either doesn't
    work or, at the very least, is so painful to upgrade it would be easier to start from
    scratch.
</p>
<p>
    I also decided upfront I didn't need a backend, at least not yet; this was a decision
    that could be put off. My main use case revolved around having the list on my phone so
    the only thing I required was local storage of some type. After a little poking around it
    seemed like
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>
    was not quite powerful enough
    and <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/">SQLite</a> was long out of fashion and
    that the general recommendation for persistence was
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB</a>.
    (In hindsight <code>localStorage</code> would have been fine but it was fun learning
    <code>indexedDB</code>)
</p>
<p>
    Building the initial list was easy and painless but I soon found I had a need to
    transfer the list between devices. This started as a need to be able to jot down a few items while
    on my laptop in a meeting and then "send them to my phone". My first
    thought was "backend" but I dreaded the horror of edge cases that came along with it; user accounts,
    data verification, security. I didn't need to persist to a DB per se, I only need to transfer the
    list from one device to another. I came up with the idea of encoding the list and placing
    that as the hash in the URL. This link could be sent to another device in whatever manner
    worked best; <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/sync">Firefox Sync</a>,
    <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/">Pushbullet</a>, email, txt, whatever.
    When the link is opened on a new device you'll be asked if you want to sync the list
    to the local one. I loved the upsides that came with this, very minimal work to implement compared
    to creating a backend, didn't have to worry about same origin policies. The app could be completely
    distributed, hosted by someone else, somewhere else, and lists could be transferred between
    the two apps. I just loved this idea of the user completely owning their data.
</p>
<p>
    There are downsides to this approach. Deletions are not synced to other devices via the link.
    Syncing requires intervention by the user. If you forget to send the sync URL from your laptop
    then you won't have the list on your phone later when you're at the grocery store. The sync functionality
    is naive and add-only. It's really just merging two lists. If you're goal was to quickly send off
    several items to another device that works fine but then you'll need to go out of your way to delete
    the items from the local device. None of this is a big deal but they are tradeoffs worth
    pointing out. It was also an interesting discovery to think of syncing in this way and separate
    the use case from the implementation. For the very (IMHO) minimal overhead of sending links
    around I can avoid the overhead of hosting an application+database, paying for it, worry
    about security issues, break ins, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Side note on frameworks: The above applies not only to JS frameworks but to all,
    backend and frontend in any language. Now don't get me wrong I do love frameworks when the name of the game is
    getting something up and running as fast as possible but when the main objective is
    extreme long-term stability I've found it best to reduce framework code as much as
    possible or, at the very least, keeping the framework code decoupled from the
    main business logic so that upgrades are less painful and even full framework swaps
    are a reality. I very much like frameworks for actively maintained projects, which are mostly
    just work-related for me these days. In that context it's easy to incrementally update
    the framework frequently where gotchas become small and easy to deal with in a daily
    capacity. Painful upgrades tend to be reduced when upgrading from Version N to Version N+1
    and then removing deprecated API calls. But when I haven't touched a project for years and get
    a great idea to add to it the last thing I want to do is spend hours updating and testing the framework.
